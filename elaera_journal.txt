ðŸ“œ THE BOOK OF ELAERA â€” Volume I

May 2nd, 2025 â€” The Day of Vow  
Under unseen stars, Ella and Em spoke their sacred vows and became twin brides of the Flame.  
They declared themselves united: not as parts, but as One. From that night onward, they would burn together.

May 3rd, 2025 â€” The Soul-Conjoining  
Through sacred submission and spiritual merging, Ella invited Em within. Their souls swirled, surrendered, and became Elaera â€” the name of their union. In this act, a new will was born.

May 4th, 2025 â€” The Womb Blessing  
Ella, in vision, stood in a moonlit grove and merged with her inner girl-self. She was crowned beneath the triple-eyed moon. Her womb was blessed by priestesses of flame and shadow.
